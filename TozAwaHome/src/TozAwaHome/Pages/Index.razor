    Considering the latest web apps development trends, we split the development into two segments: Front-End and Back-End development. Based on the above two development parts, web apps development requires 2 major roles for developers, and those are Front-End and Back-End developers. Subsequently, the web apps development necessitates various skills on both the front-end and backend side to build a complete system. Furthermore, there are several front-end frameworks, popularly, Angular, Reack.Js, Vue.js, JavaScript which again requires different skill sets and developers. However, the most popular choice for backend development, server-side logic is C# and .NET. This creates a complex scenario to build Web UI with front-end technologies and then again server-side logic with back-end technologies.

    On the other hand, we have another problematic situation in building cross-platform and multi-device applications. Subsequently, we need more resources with different skill sets based platforms. This situation creates the requirements of Android developer for Android devices, iOS developer for iOS devices, Windows developer for Windows, and Linux devices. Furthermore, an organization needs to make a huge investment and will be required more time to build cross platforms and multi-device applications.

    Blazor Hybrid Apps
    Let’s not get into a more complicated application development situation, we have a saver, Blazor Hybrid with .net core. Yes, we can easily overcome the above complex scenario by using Hybrid Blazor app with .NET core. To be more specific, Blazor Hybrid App with .NET MAUI is the solution. Blazor will let us develop interactive UI using C# instead of JavaScript or Front-End Frameworks. In other words, we can use back-end or .NET C# skill sets to develop the front-end UI. Blazor can run C# code to the client-side browser.
